# SpaceX Rocket Launch Case Study

* SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of savings is due to the reusability of first stage. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 can recover the first stage. Sometimes it does not land or sometimes it crashes or in other times, SpaceX sacrifices the first stage due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit and customer. SpaceY is a new rocket company which would like to compete with SpaceX.

* Our job is to find the correlation between the first stage landing success rate and launch parameters like payload mass, orbit type, booster types, where it is launched from and more. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of launch for SpaceY. 

* We used the SpaceX Rest API and web scraping to gather information available publicly and machine learning to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. We also performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization to gather insights from our data.
